                        <p> I am a newbie in devlopment getting into front-end web development. I started coding by learning
                        javascript. I then got into lua; I did not like it because it was too simple it was hard to understand the concepts.
                        I got into learning python and I nailed it! I got into learning java, so I learned object-oriented proggraming.
                        Now, I program in python and find object-oriented proggrammin easier than imperative programming.</p>
                        <p> This is a toy blog, I have to start from somewhere. I will iterate building outstanding websites and
                        land a job. Eventually I will create a billion-dollar website like a goldminer when he mines for gold like instagram. I like neither
                        them went to college to study computer science when they built the app. They learned to code without a degree and they made it
                        big selling their famous application, Instagram for a Billion dollars. It shows that a university level degree in computer science
                        is not needed to succeed in the tech industry.</p>
                        <p> I already know how to program in python and plan to use my knowledge of Cascading
                            style sheets, my knowledge of the HyperTextMarkupLanguage, and my knowledge of Django
                            to create outstanding web applications that take in data, processes it, and renders it.
